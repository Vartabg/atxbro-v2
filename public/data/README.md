# 3D Map Assets

For the USA map, we need a low-poly GLTF model where each state is a separate mesh.

Recommended sources from research:
- Sketchfab: "USA Map - Low Poly" by Bharad
- CGTrader: Free States 3D Models  
- TurboSquid: 3D United States Map Models

The model should have:
- Individual state meshes (not merged)
- Low polygon count for mobile performance
- Named meshes by state abbreviation
